/**
 * Use this component to report errors to the error logging service of your choice.
 * Any time an error occurs in your app, the function you pass to `onError` prop will
 * be called.  This includes errors that occur in handlers on the server as well
 * as react rendering on both client and server.  Errors that occur on the server
 * will be reported from the server.  Errors that occur on the client will be reported
 * from the client.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 *  import React, { Component } from 'react'
 *  import ErrorReporter from 'react-storefront/ErrorReporter'
 *
 *  class App extends Component {
 *
 *    render() {
 *      return (
 *        <div>
 *          <ErrorReporter onError={this.reportError}/>
 *          // ... the rest of your app goes here
 *        </div>
 *      )
 *    }
 *
 *    reportError = ({ error, stack }) => {
 *      // send error to some error reporting service
 *    }
 *
 *  }
